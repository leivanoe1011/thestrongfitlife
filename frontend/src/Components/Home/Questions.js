            Say hello to #beastmode, a simple way to achieve true body and mind
            transformation through live, virtual workouts.

          <h4>What’s Beastmode?</h4>
          <p>
            Beastmode is a term I use to describe my all-in, no-nonsense method
            of training. My workouts utilize short bursts of intense activity to
            help you break through frustrating plateaus and propel you to the
            next level of strength.
          </p>
          <p>
            You don’t have to think about a thing — just show up for your
            virtual sessions with me as your trainer and be prepared for a
            sweatfest!
          </p>

            All that’s required? A beast-like attitude, a few pieces of
            equipment, and 40 minutes a day.
